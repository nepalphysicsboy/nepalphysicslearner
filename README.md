<h1>what is <b>Physics</b>?</h1>
<p>Physics encompasses the large and the small, the old and the new. <br />
From the atom to galaxies, from electrical circuitry to aerodynamics, physics is very much<br />
 <blockqoute>a part of the world around us. 
 You probably are taking this introductory course in calculus-based </blockqoute><br />
 physics because it is required for subsequent courses that you plan to take in preparation for,<br/> 
a career in science or engineering. Your professor wants you to learn physics and to enjoy<br />
 the experience. He or she is very interested in helping you learn this fascinating subject. </p>
